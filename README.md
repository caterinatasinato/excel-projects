# üß© My Excel Projects

Welcome to my repository of Excel projects! ‚ú®
This repository showcases various projects and analyses I worked on as a trainee in **Data Analytics** at **ProfessionAI**. Each folder represents a separate project and includes detailed documentation, examples, and insights. Feel free to explore the projects below to see the approaches I used and the results I achieved. ü¶ã

### 3. Data Generation and Analysis for the Luggnagg Population üìä

This project involves creating a dataset, performing data manipulations, and conducting statistical analyses using Excel. The goal was to consolidate concepts from inferential statistics by generating and analyzing data for a fictional population.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Generation:** Simulate ages of 250 individuals using normal distribution parameters.
- **Sample Analysis:** Extract and analyze a sample to perform statistical calculations and estimations.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between age, number of cats, and partner's age.
- **Linear Regression:** Perform a regression analysis to study the relationship between age and rank.

**Folder Contents:**

- üìä **Excel Spreadsheet:** Contains datasets, calculations, and analyses.
- üìÑ **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of tasks performed, methodologies used, and analysis results.
- üìà **Charts and Graphs:** Visualizations for statistical insights, correlation analysis, and linear regression.

**Excel Workbook Structure:**
